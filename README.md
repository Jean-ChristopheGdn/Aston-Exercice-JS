# ASTON EXERCICES JAVASCRIPT

## Start : 
1. Download all the repository
2. Open file "index.html"


## Instructions

Just like the Nintendo exercise, you will be evaluated mainly on the good practices of : 
JavaScript
Documentation and self-documentation,
Naming conventions,
Algo
Git
Conventional commit,
Git Workflow,
Frequency and usefulness of commits/pushes
HTML/CSS
Page tree and style sheets,
General good practices.

You have initially 20 points, and will lose one point per bad practice identified. 
NB: a bad practice present twice on the same page will make you lose only one point. 

You can recover a lost point if : 
You use gitmojis
The pleasant appearance of the site will allow you to recover a lost point
And no, it is not possible to have more than 20/20 <3

### Exercise 0: Home Page

You must create a main web page on which you will insert links to the different exercises.
The links to the exercises will be presented as cards in the body. 
Each card will display the name and title of the exercise. 
A clickable button will take you to the page in question. 
The information on each card will be contained in the script! In other words: there will be little or nothing in your HTML!

### Exercise 1: Friendship is Magic

You will integrate a page that will list the names of the main characters of the "Friendship is magic" series, as an unordered list. 
The text will be written in white under a "rainbow" background (gradient) from pink to purple.

The display will be ENTIRELY managed by the JS script of the page: your HTML page must not contain any information except an "H1".

You will insert a minimum of style so that it is at least pleasing to the eye. 

Compensation point: an image!


### Exercise 2: The Clock

You will create a page that will display the current time as "hh:mm:s" in the center of the page. 
You will insert a minimum of style so that it is at least pleasant to look at. 

## Exercise 3: FizzBuzz

You will create a page that will display a text field with a counter ranging from 0 to 100. It will display : 
The number in question, 
Fizz if it is a multiple of 3,
Buzz if it is a multiple of 5
FizzBuzz if it is a multiple of 3 and 5.

All your code will be managed exclusively by functions.

## Exercise 4 : FizzBuzz ++

You will create a new FizzBuzz, except that : 

A box will display the number, 
Fizz, Buzz or FizzBuzz will be displayed above the number, in large size
The values will be displayed one by one,
A next button will allow to go to the next value
A "prev" button will display the previous value. 

Script recycling : 1 point of recovery <3
